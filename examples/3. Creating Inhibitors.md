# Creating Inhibitors

### Inhibitors
Inhibitors are functions that are ran before a command is processed and executed.  
Here is an inhibitor that prevents certain users from using all commands.  
In the Getting Started example, this file would be placed in the `src/inhibitors/` folder.

```js
const Inhibitor = require('discord-akairo').Inhibitor;

const blockedUsers = [
    '1234',
    '5678',
    '1357',
    '2468'
];

function exec(message){
    if (blockedUsers.includes(message.author.id)){
        return true;
    }
}

module.exports = new Inhibitor('blacklist', 'blacklist', exec);
```

In this example, if the author's ID is one of the ones in the blacklist, the command will be blocked!
