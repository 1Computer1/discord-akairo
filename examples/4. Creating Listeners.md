# Creating Listeners

### Listeners
Listeners are functions that are ran when an event is emitted from an EventEmitter.  
This is part of node.js and Akairo provides Listener to easily manage them.  
In the Getting Started example, this file would be placed in the `src/listeners/` folder.

```js
const Listener = require('discord-akairo').Listener;

function exec(message, command, reason){
    const replies = {
        owner: 'You are not the bot owner!',
        guild: 'You can only use this command in a guild!',
        dm: 'You can only use this command in a DM!',
        blacklist: 'I don\'t like you >:c'
    };

    if (replies[reason]) message.reply(replies[reason]);
}

module.exports = new Listener('commandBlocked', 'commandHandler', 'commandBlocked', 'on', exec);
```

The client and CommandHandler events can be used with `'client'` or `'commandHandler'`.  
Other EventEmitters can be used by passing it directly.
