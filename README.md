### Has slash commands

For slash commands to work you need to add execslash to the command and when it recieves a command it will try and run it

new events:
 * slashError
 * slashBlocked
    * owner
    * superuser
 * slashStarted
 * slashNotFound
 * slashGuildOnly

for more info about these events view the [source code](https://github.com/SkyBlockDev/discord-akairo/blob/master/src/struct/commands/CommandHandler.js#L396)

Also if someone wants to add slash commands and superuseronly to the test

examples:
```ts
import { Command } from "discord-akairo";
import type { Message, GuildMember, ImageSize, AllowedImageFormat, CommandInteraction } from "discord.js";
import { MessageEmbed } from "discord.js";
import { GetMember } from "../../Lib/Utils";
export default class AvatarCommand extends Command {
	public constructor() {
		super("avatar", {
			aliases: ["avatar", "av"],
			category: "Info",
			slash:true,
			options: [
        			{
					type: 6,
					name: "user",
					description: "User you want the avatar of",
					required: false,
				}
      			]
		});
	}
	exec(message) {
		message.reply("This also works")
	}
	async execSlash(message: CommandInteraction) {
		const member = message.options[0]?.user ?? message.user;
		return message.reply(
			this.client.util
				.embed()
				.setTitle(`${member.username}'s Avatar`)
				.setURL(member.displayAvatarURL({ format: "png", size: 512, dynamic: true }))
				.setColor(this.client.colors.green)
				.setImage(member.displayAvatarURL({ format: "png", size: 512, dynamic: true }))
		);
	}
}
```
