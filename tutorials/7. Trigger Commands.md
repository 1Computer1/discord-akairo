This tutorial is for commands that are triggered with regex.  
We will make a command that replies with an image when someone says "lewd".  

## Lewd

Create a new command.  
There will be some differences.  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message){
    return message.channel.sendFile('REDACTED');
}

module.exports = new Command('lewd', exec, {
    trigger: /lewd/i
});
```

There is only one command option!  
The `trigger` option is a regular expression used to match message contents.  
Aliases and arguments are not used (restrictions and inhibitors still work, obviously).  

## Lewder

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, args){
    return message.channel.sendFile('REDACTED ' + args[1] || '0');
}

module.exports = new Command('lewd', exec, {
    trigger: /lewd(\d?)/i
});
```

You can also use the `args` parameter to get the matched content.  
Here, a number is matched after "lewd" to get different pictures.
