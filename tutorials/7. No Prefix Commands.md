This tutorial is for commands that are triggered with regex or a simple check.  
We will make a command that replies with an image when someone says "lewd".  
We will also make a command that harasses someone (I'm kidding).  

## Regex Trigger

Create a new command.  
There will be some differences.  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message){
    return message.channel.sendFile('REDACTED');
}

module.exports = new Command('lewd', exec, {
    trigger: /lewd/i
});
```

There is only one command option!  
The `trigger` option is a regular expression used to match message contents.  
Aliases and arguments are not used (restrictions and inhibitors still work, obviously).  

All regex triggers will have the second parameter of `match` for matched content.  
A global regex will also pass a third parameter, `groups`.  
These are all the groups matched by the regex.  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, match, groups){
    for (const [, digit] of groups){
        // Don't actually spam something like this!
        message.channel.sendFile('REDACTED ' + digit || '0');
    }
}

module.exports = new Command('lewd', exec, {
    trigger: /lewd(\d?)/gi
});
```

## Condition Trigger

A condition trigger is like a regex one, but lets you do things not related to the content.  

```js
const { Command } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message){
    return message.reply('Hi friend!');
}

module.exports = new Command('lewd', exec, {
    condition: message => message.author.id === '172002275412279296'
});
```

This command will run whenever that specific person sends a message.  
Like regex commands, arguments are not parsed.
