This tutorial is for creating a listener.  
We will make a listener for the user blocks from the previous tutorial.  

## Blocked

First, go to your listener directory.  
Create a new .js file and call it whatever you like.  
Then, require and export a new `Listener` from discord-akairo.  
The parameters of the Listener constructor are the ID, the execution function, then the options.  

```js
const { Listener } = require('discord-akairo');

function exec(message, command, reason){
    if (reason === 'guild') return message.reply('Guild only command!');
    if (reason === 'blocked') return message.reply('I don\'t like you >:c');
}

module.exports = new Listener('blocked', exec, {
    emitter: 'commandHandler',
    eventName: 'commandBlocked',
    type: 'on'
});
```

The listener now listens to the command handler for when a command is blocked.  
The emitter name `commandHandler` comes from `client.listenerHandler.emitters`.  
You can add more to that by setting the `emitters` option in your client.  

(By the way, inhibitors with type `pre` goes to the event `messageBlocked`.)  

## Word Listener

This tutorial used to exist, but a better method was added instead of using `messageInvalid`.  
See the 7th tutorial on trigger commands.
