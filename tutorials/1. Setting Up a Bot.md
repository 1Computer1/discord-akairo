This tutorial is for setting up a bot.  
All tutorials require that you have knowledge of JS and how to use Discord JS.  

## The Client

First, make a .js file and name it what you like.  
Then, require and declare a new `AkairoClient` from discord-akairo.  
Remember to fill the options with what you want.  

```js
const { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');
const client = new AkairoClient({
    ownerID: '123992700587343872',
    prefix: '$'
});

client.login('token').then(() => {
    console.log('Ready!');
});
```

Of course, this bot doesn't do much at the moment other than login.  
We now can add commands, inhibitors, or listeners.  
Create some folders to hold these and add them to the options:  

```js
const { AkairoClient } = require('discord-akairo');
const client = new AkairoClient({
    ownerID: '123992700587343872',
    prefix: '$',
    commandDirectory: './commands/',
    inhibitorDirectory: './commands/',
    listenerDirectory: './listeners/'
});

client.login('token').then(() => {
    console.log('Ready!');
});
```

Once there are commands, inhibitors, or listeners, they will be loaded.  
See their respective tutorials to learn how to use them.
