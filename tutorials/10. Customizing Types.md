This tutorial is for the following:

- Adding new argument types
- Types returning Promises
- Types that changes based on previous arguments

No commands will be demonstrated here, just the workings.  

### Adding New Types

Sometimes it can be tedious to copy-paste type functions.  
So here's how to add new types.  

```js
const client = new AkairoClient({ ... });

// This is done to create the handlers before login in order to add new types.
client.build();

// A type that only allows the first three U.S. presidents, for some reason.
client.commandHandler.addType('presidents', (word, message) => {
    if (!word) return null;

    const lower = word.toLowerCase();
    if (!['washington', 'adams', 'jefferson'].includes(lower)) return null;

    return lower;
});
```

The first check makes sure that the input exists and not an empty string.  
The second check makes sure that the word is a president.  
Note that they return `null`.  
To the resolver, this means that the type casting has failed, and that it should move on to prompting or using the default.  
The end result is the lowercase name of the president.  

### Promise Types

Here's a type that returns a Promise.  

```js
client.commandHandler.addType('pokemon', (word, message) => {
    if (!word) return null;
    return request.get('https://www.example.com').then(res => {
        // Do something here...
        if (isGood) return someValue;
        if (isBad) return Promise.reject();
    });
});
```

Instead of returning `null` to signify that the casting failed, simply reject with anything (other than an error).  
The resolved value is the value that will be used in the final arguments.  

### Changing Types

Sometimes you want an argument to change its type depending on something.  
The following is inside a `CommandOptions`.  

```js
args: [
    {
        id: 'option',
        type: ['number', 'string']
    },
    {
        id: 'changing',
        type: function(word, message, args) {
            return this.handler.resolver[args.option](word);
        }
    }
]
```

As you can see, depending on if `number` or `string` was inputted, the type of the `changing` args changes.  
The `args` object are all the previous arguments.  
It is also present in the `match` and `default` function and the `PromptOptions` functions.
